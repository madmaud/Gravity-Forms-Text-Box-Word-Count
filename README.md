# Gravity-Forms-Word-Count
Built originally for Gravity Forms to provide a simple word count and text area limiter, it could be used for just about any form by changing the code to target the appropriate CSS.
In the Gravity Forms text area, add m2d2-check-word-count under "Advanced" to allow for additional targeting.
The code targets the specific texta area by adding the ID at the end. Change this so it can target the one you want. Currently, the number count is hard coded.
