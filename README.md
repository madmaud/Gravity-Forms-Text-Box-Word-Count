# Gravity-Forms-Text-Box-Word-Count
Built originally for Gravity Forms to provide a simple word count and text area limiter, it could be used for just about any form by changing the code to target the appropriate CSS.
In the Gravity Forms text area, add the class m2d2-check-word-count under "Advanced."
The code also targets the built in specific texta area CSS by adding the form number and field ID at the end. Change this so it can target the one you want. 
Currently, the number count is hard coded and has to be changed in the file. There's no GUI input at this time.
